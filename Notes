Notes on 64 Bit Mode
64-bit mode implements register extensions through a group of instruction
prefixes, called REX prefixes. These extensions add eight GPRs (R8–R15), widen all GPRs to 64 bits,
and add eight YMM/XMM registers (YMM/XMM8–15). 
64-Bit Addresses and Operands. In 64-bit mode, the default virtual-address size is 64 bits
(implementations can have fewer). The default operand size for most instructions is 32 bits. For most
instructions, these defaults can be overridden on an instruction-by-instruction basis using instruction
prefixes. REX prefixes specify the 64-bit operand size and register extensions.
RIP-Relative Data Addressing. 64-bit mode supports data addressing relative to the 64-bit
instruction pointer (RIP). The legacy x86 architecture supports IP-relative addressing only in control40332 Rev 4.00 April 2020 AMD64 Architecture Programmer's Manual, Volumes 1-5

transfer instructions. RIP-relative addressing improves the efficiency of position-independent code
and code that addresses global data.
Opcodes. A few instruction opcodes and prefix bytes are redefined to allow register extensions and
64-bit addressing. These differences are described in Appendix B “General-Purpose Instructions in
64-Bit Mode” and Appendix C “Differences Between Long Mode and Legacy Mode” in Volume 3.
